# Hunt

Check the Demo file for screenshots!!
**Note:This project is a work in progress, development of the mobile component has not begun yet**


- Hunt is inspired by traditional treasure hunt games where the game master makes the clues and hides them in several
locations (hoping they don't get lost). This process can be quiet tedious and time consuming.

- In Hunt, users will be able to login to the website and design their hunt: adding clues, save clues, etc... through
an interactive drag and drop workspace

- This project has 2 components:
Website and Mobile application

- As explained above, the website will be used to design hunts as its primary function, while the mobile application 
will allow users to participate in hunts, monitor hunt progress, and most importantly submit images to solve clues

> ### Note:
> Images will be authenticateed as clue solutions through an image recognition platform, I want to train my own
image recognition network if possible in the near future, or other options include subscribing to google's object recognition
API
